What is Buckets?
 -Buckets in hive is used in segregating of hive table-data into multiple files or directories. it is used for efficient querying.

  -The data i.e. present in that partitions can be divided further into Buckets
  -The division is performed based on Hash of particular columns that we selected in the table.
  -Buckets use some form of Hashing algorithm at back end to read each record and place it into buckets
  -In Hive, we have to enable buckets by using the set.hive.enforce.bucketing=true;
  
  
CREATE TABLE zipcodes(
RecordNumber int,
